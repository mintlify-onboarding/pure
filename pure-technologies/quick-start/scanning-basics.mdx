Matrix Scan

The Matrix Scan is a multiple-slab scan tool, that can scan hundreds of slabs at once. There are two methods to do matrix scanning effectively:

**Scan and Continue:**

Using the Matrix Scan tool, you can pan around to view multiple coins at once that are not in the same frame. Simply scan and go.

**All-in-One Frame:**

You may use the Matrix Scan tool to be able to scan more than one coin in a frame, allowing for ease of onboarding inventory and seeing a large number of coins at once. No need to worry about capturing the same coin twice, we account for this and only look for unique scans.
