<Accordion title="Step 3: Scanning your First Coin(s)">
The Collect Pure iOS app supports and can scan all certified rare coins graded by Third-Party graders PCGS, NGC, and CAC. Pure also supports older generation holders (OGH + Old Fatty) and can decode the differences between NGC & PCGS coins so you do not have to specify the grade/service used to grade the coin.

For **PCGS** coins:
