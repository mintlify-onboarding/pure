An example color analysis for an 1881-S Morgan Silver Dollar

## How does this work?

ObverseAI makes use of color scales meticulously crafted by professional numismatists and researchers, such as Brandon Kelley and Doug Kurz, to dissect colors and generate scores for individual coins. These professionals have detailed the color progression spectrum of naturally toned colors, starting with Morgan dollars, as demonstrated below. This process allows ObverseAI to accurately assess and rate each coin based on established industry standards.

### How to Generate an ObverseAI Toning Report

To be able to generate a toning report for a specific certification lookup, it must follow the following criteria:

* PCGS Certified & Soon NGC

* TrueView Add-On & Soon NGC PhotoVision

* Metal Content is Silver (Gold Soon)

If these criteria are met, a ðŸŒˆ emoji will automatically appear in the upper right-hand corner of the page. If the criteria are not met, then a toning report cannot be generated at this time. Click on the ðŸŒˆ to open the ObverseAI generator page.

After generation, you should see a result that outputs a score/letter grade, as well as the associated graphs and color scale for that particular coin. You can toggle between the Obverse & Reverse scores as well as between the Letter & Score!

### Wait Times & Generation Period

Please be aware that due to the advanced computations required to analyze and evaluate each coin, the process may take approximately 1-2 minutes per item. We appreciate your patience, as this intricate procedure is still under production and being fine-tuned for optimal performance.

### Artificial Toning Detection (In Development)

A standout feature of ObverseAI is its capacity to distinguish colors from a toned coin and cross-reference them with thousands of naturally and artificially toned examples. This functionality enables ObverseAI to confidently differentiate between toning caused by artificial and natural sources. Notably, it identifies color progression, natural patterns, and minute anomalies, providing collectors with a comprehensive analysis of their coin(s).
