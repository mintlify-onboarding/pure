## Overview

The Inventory/Collection feature in the Pure app provides a seamless solution for tracking and managing certified coins from respected grading services like PCGS, NGC, and CAC. It offers users the ability to sort their collections by denomination and date, and segment coins based on the grading service. One of the most powerful elements of this feature is its capability to calculate the real-time aggregate value of the user's collection. This comprehensive and user-friendly tool is designed to simplify coin inventory/collection management, providing valuable insights into the value and composition of your collection in real-time.
