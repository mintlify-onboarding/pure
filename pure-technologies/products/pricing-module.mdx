An Overview of the Process of Pricing Coins

Pure calculates real-time value by looking at "Market Intensity" factors, or market health for a specific coin. Attributions such as old holders, CAC stickers, plus grades, and more all factor into the pricing of a specific rare coin within the model. Furthermore, these historical sales can be viewed with a simple tap and assessed as normal listings.

NOTE: Pure prices are estimates and are not to be mistaken for actual prices, if the data retrieved is false then please open a support ticket.
