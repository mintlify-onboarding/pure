## About Pure's Pricing Module

Pure has aggregated the largest auction records database to date, with over 7+ million records corresponding to over 200,000 type coins and variety attributions. Pure's mission is to provide price transparency for collectors, dealers, and auction houses, so users can make informed and actionable decisions. Here's a brief look into the model and how it calculates an accurate real-time value:

Pure calculates real-time value by looking at "Market Intensity" factors, or market health for a specific coin. Attributions such as old holders, CAC stickers, plus grades, and more all factor into the pricing of a specific rare coin within the model. Furthermore, these historical sales can be viewed with a simple tap and assessed as normal listings.

NOTE: Pure prices are estimates and are not to be mistaken for actual prices, if the data retrieved is false then please open a support ticket.
